### If Else

```python
if a > b :
    #code
elif b > a :
    #code
else:
    #code
```
### For 
For loop is used to iterate over arrays(list, tuple, set, dictionary) or strings.
```python
lista=("Iphone","Pixel","Samsung")
for i in lista:
    print(i)
```
### While
While is also used to iterate a set of statements based on a condition. Usually while is preferred when number of ierations is not known in advance.
```python
while condition  
    #code 
```
### Listas:
List is a collection which is ordered and can be changed. Lists are specified in square brackets.
```python
mylist=["iPhone","Pixel","Samsung"]
print(mylist)
```
### Tuplas:
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and can not be changed. Tuples are specified in round brackets.
```python
myTuple=("iPhone","Pixel","Samsung")
print(myTuple)
```
Below throws an error if you assign another value to tuple again.
```python
myTuple=("iPhone","Pixel","Samsung")
print(myTuple)
myTuple[1]="onePlus"
print(myTuple)
```
### Conjuntos:
Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. Sets are specified in curly brackets.
```python
myset{"iPhone","Pixel","Samsung"}
print{myset}
```
### Diccionarios:
Dictionary is a collection of key value pairs which is unordered, can be changed, and indexed. They are written in curly brackets with key - value pairs.
```python
mydict = {
    "brand" :"iPhone",
        "model": "iPhone 11"
        }
        print(mydict)
```
